Got it ‚úÖ Thanks for clarifying! So this second project is about:

* Running **Mistral locally** (not cloud like OpenAI/Gemini).
* Taking **2000+ documents (HTML/PDF)**.
* **Chunking them** ‚Üí creating embeddings ‚Üí storing them in FAISS (a vector database).
* Then passing a query to **Mistral** which searches through vectors + context and answers.

Since this is heavier and more complex, let‚Äôs build a **step-by-step beginner-friendly README** that explains:

1. What the project does (in simple terms).
2. What needs to be installed.
3. How to download and use the Mistral model locally.
4. How to configure paths (config.py).
5. How to run the program (`main.py`).
6. What happens behind the scenes (so they understand vectors/chunks).
7. Troubleshooting common problems.

# üìò Mistral Local Document Q\&A

This project lets you **ask questions about a large collection of documents (2000+ HTML/PDF files)** using the **Mistral AI model**, which runs **completely on your computer** (no internet needed once set up).

Behind the scenes, the program:

1. Breaks your documents into **chunks** (smaller pieces).
2. Turns those chunks into **vectors** (mathematical representations).
3. Stores them in a **FAISS index** (a special database for fast search).
4. When you ask a question ‚Üí it finds the most relevant chunks ‚Üí passes them to **Mistral** ‚Üí and Mistral answers.

## ‚úÖ What You Need Before Starting

1. **A computer with at least 16GB RAM** (more is better).
2. **Python 3.10 or higher** ‚Üí [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   * During installation, check ‚úÖ ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù.
3. **Visual Studio Community (FREE)** ‚Üí [Download here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

   * During installation, check ‚úÖ **Python development**.
4. **Mistral model file (GGUF format)**:

   * Download [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-Q4\_K\_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF).
   * Save it in a folder and note the full file path

---

## üõ† Step 1: Install Required Python Packages

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Clone or open this project folder.
3. Open the **Terminal** (View ‚Üí Terminal).
4. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

5. Activate it:

   * Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * Mac/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

6. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üõ† Step 2: Configure the Project

The project has a file called `config_template.py`.
You need to rename it and update the paths.

1. In Visual Studio, open `config.py` and edit these lines:

```python
# Full path of Mistral model file
MODEL_PATH = r"C:/Users/YourName/Models/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-q4_k_m.gguf"

# Where FAISS index will be stored
FAISS_INDEX_FILE = r"faiss_store"

# Folder where your input HTML documents are located
(Download All HTML files from shared LLM Google Drive, download entire folder "01_business_requirements", unzip it.)

FILE_PATH = r"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/html_files"

# Folder where converted PDFs will be saved(Program will convert HTML files to PDFs, so create a folder and provide the folder path where PDFs will be stored)
PDF_FILE_PATH = r"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/pdfs"

# Where embeddings (vector representations) will be stored
EMBEDDINGS_FILE = r"embeddings.npy"
```

üí° Notes:

* Use **absolute paths** (full location of the folder/file).
* On Windows, put `r""` before paths so backslashes `\` work correctly.

---

## üõ† Step 3: Prepare Your Documents

1. Put all your **HTML files** inside the folder you set in `FILE_PATH`.
2. The program will automatically:

   * Convert them into PDFs ‚Üí save inside `PDF_FILE_PATH`.
   * Break them into chunks.
   * Create embeddings.
   * Store embeddings in FAISS.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 4: Run the Program

Once everything is set:

1. In Visual Studio, right-click `main.py` ‚Üí **Set as Startup File**.
2. Click the **green Run button (‚ñ∂)** at the top.

‚úÖ The program will:

* Read all your HTML/PDFs.
* Chunk them.
* Create embeddings.
* Store them in FAISS.
* Then you can start asking questions interactively.

---

## üéØ Example Flow

Suppose you have 2000 company reports in `html_files/`.
You run the program ‚Üí it builds the FAISS index.

Then you ask:

```
"What are the top 5 risks mentioned in these reports?"
```

Mistral will:

* Look into FAISS ‚Üí find the most relevant chunks.
* Use those chunks as context.
* Generate a detailed answer for you.

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

* **Model not found** ‚Üí Check that `MODEL_PATH` in `config.py` points to the `.gguf` file.
* **Memory issues** ‚Üí Try fewer documents or a smaller quantized model (Q4\_K\_M is already optimized).
* **Path errors** ‚Üí Make sure you use full paths (`C:/Users/...`) not relative ones.
* **Missing packages** ‚Üí Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.
